# JavaScript Console Quiz Game

## 📌 Overview
This project is a simple JavaScript quiz game that runs entirely in the **browser console**. It asks the user a series of questions using `prompt()`, checks their answers, provides instant feedback using `alert()`, and finally displays the total score.

The project demonstrates the use of **arrays, loops, functions, conditionals, input handling, and string methods** in JavaScript.

---

## 🎯 Features
- Minimum 5 quiz questions stored in an array  
- Uses a `runQuiz()` function for clean code structure  
- Input normalization using `toLowerCase()` and `trim()`  
- Real-time feedback for correct & incorrect answers  
- Score tracking throughout the quiz  
- Final score displayed at the end  
- Entirely runs inside the browser console

1. Use arrays to store multiple values (questions & answers)  
2. Use loops (specifically `for` loops) to iterate items  
3. Write and call JavaScript functions  
4. Take user input using `prompt()`  
5. Display output using `alert()`  
6. Clean and compare strings using `trim()` + `toLowerCase()`  
7. Implement conditionals (`if-else`)  
8. Maintain a score counter  
9. Improve logical thinking and debugging skills
